<h3><kbd>The Playground</kbd></h3>
<h4> The playground has recently been rebuilt and upgraded with funding from the PTA. It has multiple slides and places where you can play during recess. There is a jungle gym, monkey bars, and some swings. Many students enjoy playing there, and even go there after school to play and have fun with their friends. We hope that if your child comes over to MPS, he/she enjoys our newly updated playground as well! (The picture is of the old playground.) </h4>

<h3><kbd>The Gymnasium/Stage</kbd></h3>
<h4> The gym/stage area is where we do PE, the Bobcat Fitness Club, and so much more! We use the stage for performances and assemblies, while the gym is mainly used for PE. CRS's gymnasium is massive, with 4 basketball hoops, a rock climbing wall, and all sorts of equipment in the storage room. The stage is also pretty big, and we have had many assemblies there, with the performers/presenters on the stage, while the students are sitting on the gym floor. </h4>

<h4> Churchill Road provides 4 levels of this program. Level 1 (Critical and Creative Thinking Lessons) is provided to students grades K-6, and consists of model lessons that are designed to teach critical and creative thinking skills. The lessons are modeled in all classrooms by Advanced Academic Resource Teachers (AARTs) and the thinking strategies are then used throughout the year by classroom and other teachers who work with students. Student responses to these lessons are used as part of the identification process for Levels II-IV. Parents may also practice these strategies during family conversations and activities. In Level 2 (Differentiated Lessons in Areas of Academic Strength, Grades ), the AART collaborates with classroom teachers to provide additional challenges through lessons and resources that extend and enrich the Program of Studies. Screening for this level of service is ongoing throughout the school year. For Level 3 (Part-Time Advanced Academic Programs), students identified by our local Advanced Academic committee work directly with the AART each week in a small group setting. During this time, students are challenged with enrichment and extension activities developed to enhance grade-level curriculum. Finally, for Level 4 (Full-Time Advanced Academic Programs), Students found eligible for placement in full-time Level IV Advanced Academic Programs through a central selection process receive a highly challenging instructional program in the four core subject areas. Churchill Road houses an AAP that draws identified gifted students from a number of neighboring elementary schools including Kent Gardens and Spring Hill . Currently there are multiple classrooms at each grade level from grades 3 through 6. Students in the AAP center study the same Fairfax County Program of Studies curriculum as do students in the base school with instructional techniques that are designed to match the educational learning styles of gifted students. All AAP students are instructed one year ahead in math and are engaged in a Mathematics contest called "Continental Math." Additional language arts, science and history units for gifted students, designed by the College of William and Mary's Center for Gifted Education, are part of the enriched AAP curriculum. Higher level thinking skills are stressed through class discussions and project-based learning, which allow students to learn to work together to solve problems. Technology is used as a tool for learning with all students. Students use computers for word processing, creating graphs, spreadsheets, and databases, designing multimedia presentations, and to access the Internet for research. </h4>

<h4> The Foreign Language in the Elementary School/Language through Content (FLES/LTC) Program helps students learn a world language through Science and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics) integrated content. The program provides language learning opportunities to all students in an elementary school from grades K through 6th. The goal of FLES/LTC is to develop students’ language proficiency and 21st-century skills by teaching World Languages through STEAM, with a strong emphasis on Science. Teachers use Project-Based Learning to help students learn another language while developing skills in all areas. Generally, students receive 60 minutes of language instruction per week. This model supports the five goal areas of the national standards for world language (communication, culture, connections, comparisons, and communities) and is aligned with the Virginia SOL for World Languages. </h4>

Parents/guardians may choose to opt out their child of all or part of the Family Life Education program.  Students who are opted out are provided with age-appropriate, nonpunitive, alternative health instruction, and every effort is made to foster respect for family choices.  If you wish to opt out your child  of all or part of FLE, please fill in the opt-out form and return it to the school prior to Family Life Education instruction. FLE grade level-specific lessons and media that FCPS has streaming rights for are available for parents online in FCPS 24-7 (Blackboard) Parent View.  Account information is available at your local school or online. Grade level-specific lessons are also available at the Fairfax County Regional Library in the City of Fairfax (this location does not have media).

<h4> After weeks of hard work, excitement, and anticipation, our newest masterpiece is finally done! Our new playground! It has many additions to the old one, with a colorful playground set, a new set of monkey bars, an infinity loop, a new jungle gym, and so much more! A reminder that students will need to social distance at 6 feet apart while using the playground equipment, due to the exercise that they are putting in. We hope that you enjoy the playground a lot, and we can't wait to see our students play in our newly upgraded, updated playground! On the morning announcements, Mr. Varhol (or Mr. V) shared some tips for playing safely on the new playground, and we suggest that you follow those great tips that he came up with. Our playground is plenty big enough for all of the students on it to social distance, so that is what they should be doing for the WHOLE TIME, always while playing on the equipment and at recess. All of us at Churchill hope that your child has a wonderful time using and playing on our new playground, and we hope to see you soon! </h4>

<p class="p_modal"> Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson (born 15 April 1990) is an English actress, model, and activist. She has gained recognition for her roles in both blockbusters and independent films, as well as her women's rights work. Watson has been ranked among the world's highest-paid actresses by Forbes and Vanity Fair, and was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2015. As a child, she rose to stardom after landing her first professional acting role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter film series, having acted only in school plays previously. Watson also starred in the 2007 television adaptation of the novel Ballet Shoes and lent her voice to The Tale of Despereaux (2008). After the final Harry Potter film, she took on a supporting role in My Week with Marilyn (2011), before starring as a flirtatious, free-spirited student in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) to critical success. Further acclaim came from portraying Alexis Neiers in Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring (2013) and the titular character's adoptive daughter in the biblical epic Noah. That same year, Watson was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, winning British Artist of the Year. She starred as Belle in the musical romantic fantasy Beauty and the Beast (2017), which ranks among the highest-grossing films of all time, and Meg March in the coming-of-age drama Little Women (2019), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

<p class="p_modal"> Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter is an American singer and songwriter. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which featured the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy". Following the 2006 disbandment of Destiny's Child, she released her second solo album, B'Day, which contained hit singles "Irreplaceable" and "Beautiful Liar". Beyoncé also starred in multiple films such as The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), Obsessed (2009), and The Lion King (2019). Her marriage to Jay-Z and her portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010. It spawned the successful singles "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", and "Halo". After splitting from her manager and father Mathew Knowles in 2010, Beyoncé released her musically diverse fourth album 4 in 2011. She later achieved universal acclaim for her sonically experimental visual albums, Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), the latter of which was the world's best-selling album of 2016 and the most acclaimed album of her career, exploring themes of infidelity and womanism. In 2018, she released Everything Is Love, a collaborative album with her husband, Jay-Z, as the Carters. As a featured artist, Beyoncé topped the Billboard Hot 100 with the remixes of "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran in 2017 and "Savage" by Megan Thee Stallion in 2020. The same year, she released the musical film and visual album Black Is King to widespread acclaim.

<p class="p_modal"> Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name 'Katy Perry' (from her mother's maiden name) and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007. Perry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the controversial U.S number one song "I Kissed a Girl" and "Hot n Cold". Three subsequent albums have topped the U.S. Billboard 200. The disco-influenced Teenage Dream (2010) spawned five chart-topping U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles–"California Gurls", "Teenage Dream", "Firework", "E.T.", and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" — a record tying her with Michael Jackson's Bad. Its follow-up record Prism (2013) was inspired by her divorce, and incorporates pop and dance along with themes of self-reflection, everyday life, and relationships. With the music videos for its chart-topping songs "Roar" and "Dark Horse", Perry became the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo. 2017's electropop Witness featured a political subtext and a theme of liberation. Her sixth studio album Smile followed in 2020.
