                </h5>
                <p>Churchill Road provides 4 levels of this program. Level 1 (Critical and Creative Thinking Lessons) is provided to students grades K-6, and consists of model lessons that are designed to teach critical and creative thinking skills. The lessons are modeled in all classrooms by Advanced Academic Resource Teachers (AARTs) and the thinking strategies are then used throughout the year by classroom and other teachers who work with students. Student responses to these lessons are used as part of the identification process for Levels II-IV. Parents may also practice these strategies during family conversations and activities. In Level 2 (Differentiated Lessons in Areas of Academic Strength, Grades ), the AART collaborates with classroom teachers to provide additional challenges through lessons and resources that extend and enrich the Program of Studies. Screening for this level of service is ongoing throughout the school year. For Level 3 (Part-Time Advanced Academic Programs), students identified by our local Advanced Academic committee work directly with the AART each week in a small group setting. During this time, students are challenged with enrichment and extension activities developed to enhance grade-level curriculum. Finally, for Level 4 (Full-Time Advanced Academic Programs), Students found eligible for placement in full-time Level IV Advanced Academic Programs through a central selection process receive a highly challenging instructional program in the four core subject areas. Churchill Road houses an AAP that draws identified gifted students from a number of neighboring elementary schools including Kent Gardens and Spring Hill . Currently there are multiple classrooms at each grade level from grades 3 through 6. Students in the AAP center study the same Fairfax County Program of Studies curriculum as do students in the base school with instructional techniques that are designed to match the educational learning styles of gifted students. All AAP students are instructed one year ahead in math and are engaged in a Mathematics contest called "Continental Math." Additional language arts, science and history units for gifted students, designed by the College of William and Mary's Center for Gifted Education, are part of the enriched AAP curriculum. Higher level thinking skills are stressed through class discussions and project-based learning, which allow students to learn to work together to solve problems. Technology is used as a tool for learning with all students. Students use computers for word processing, creating graphs, spreadsheets, and databases, designing multimedia presentations, and to access the Internet for research.</p>

                </h5>
                <p>The Foreign Language in the Elementary School/Language through Content (FLES/LTC) Program helps students learn a world language through Science and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics) integrated content. The program provides language learning opportunities to all students in an elementary school from grades K through 6th. The goal of FLES/LTC is to develop students’ language proficiency and 21st-century skills by teaching World Languages through STEAM, with a strong emphasis on Science. Teachers use Project-Based Learning to help students learn another language while developing skills in all areas. Generally, students receive 60 minutes of language instruction per week. This model supports the five goal areas of the national standards for world language (communication, culture, connections, comparisons, and communities) and is aligned with the Virginia SOL for World Languages.</p>
